# Udacity-Datastructure-and-Algorithm-Nanodegree
This repository contains the 4 assignments I completed in my Data Structure and Algorithms Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Week 0
This assignment refreshes our concepts of using dictionary and sets in python.

## Week 1
This assignment covers the foundations of Data Structures including Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Recursion, Trees, Maps, and Hashing.

## Week 2
This assignment covers basic algorithms including Binary Search, Heaps, Tries, Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, and Heap sort), and Divide and Conquer Algorithms.

## Week 3
This assignment covers advanced algorithms including Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming. The final project utilized the A* Algorithm to create a route planner.
